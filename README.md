CS308 Databases Final Project - Wildbook

**Programming Languages Used:** MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS

----------
Wildbook is a rudimentary social network site. Users can sign up, log in, and proceed to post "diary entries" of their
day to day activities. In addition, users can create their own customized profile where they can say whatever they want,
as well as being able to request and accept friends with other users. They can also recommend activities and locations 
for others. Many new activities and posts will show up on the news feed on the front page.

Basically, it's a super simplified version of facebook.


----------
Updated, but some functions of the site does not work. Primarily, the image uploading feature. Everything else should work fine though.
Might have a few bugs here and there but this is the version that was submitted.
