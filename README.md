CS308 Databases Final Project - Wildbook

----------
Wildbook is a rudimentary social network site. Users can sign up, log in, and proceed to post "diary entries" of their
day to day activities. In addition, users can create their own customized profile where they can say whatever they want,
as well as being able to request and accept friends with other users. They can also recommend activities and locations 
for others. Many new activities and posts will show up on the news feed on the front page.

Basically, it's a super simplified version of facebook.
